You're right, and I apologize for the error. Let me provide a completely different approach for the OpenLiteSpeed installation:



I've completely rewritten the OpenLiteSpeed installation function with a fundamentally different approach that should solve the freezing issues:

## Complete Approach Change

Instead of using the interactive one-click installer that was freezing, I've switched to a direct repository-based installation that is much more reliable:

1. **Repository-Based Installation**
   ```bash
   # Skip the interactive installer completely and use the repository method directly
   print_message "Adding LiteSpeed repository..." "info"
   sudo wget -O - https://rpms.litespeedtech.com/debian/enable_lst_debian_repo.sh | sudo bash
   
   print_message "Updating package lists..." "info"
   sudo apt-get update
   
   print_message "Installing OpenLiteSpeed package..." "info"
   sudo apt-get install -y openlitespeed
   ```
   This method uses standard package management which is more reliable and doesn't hang.

2. **Separate LSPHP Installation**
   ```bash
   # Install the appropriate LSPHP version
   print_message "Installing LSPHP ${PHP_VERSION}..." "info"
   local LSPHP_VERSION=${PHP_VERSION/./}
   
   sudo apt-get install -y lsphp$LSPHP_VERSION lsphp$LSPHP_VERSION-common lsphp$LSPHP_VERSION-mysql...
   ```
   By separately installing LSPHP, we have more control over the process and better error handling.

3. **Improved Error Recovery**
   ```bash
   if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
       print_message "Failed to install LSPHP $LSPHP_VERSION. Trying a different version..." "warning"
       
       # Try PHP 8.1 as fallback
       LSPHP_VERSION="81"
       PHP_VERSION="8.1"
       
       sudo apt-get install -y lsphp$LSPHP_VERSION...
   ```
   The script now has specific fallback versions if the requested PHP version isn't available.

4. **Direct Password Management**
   ```bash
   # Generate a new admin password (8-12 characters, alphanumeric)
   OLS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=$(head /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | head -c 10)
   
   # Set the admin password
   if [ -f "/usr/local/lsws/admin/misc/admpass.sh" ]; then
       print_message "Setting admin password..." "info"
       sudo /usr/local/lsws/admin/misc/admpass.sh admin "$OLS_ADMIN_PASSWORD"
   ```
   Directly sets the password without relying on the installer's password generation.

5. **Better Service Verification**
   ```bash
   # Verify service is running
   if ! systemctl is-active --quiet lsws; then
       print_message "Warning: OpenLiteSpeed service failed to start. Attempting to restart..." "warning"
       sudo systemctl restart lsws
       sleep 3
       
       if ! systemctl is-active --quiet lsws; then
           print_message "OpenLiteSpeed service failed to start. You may need to start it manually." "error"
       fi
   ```
   More thorough service status checking and automatic recovery attempts.

This completely different approach bypasses the problematic interactive installer in favor of a much more reliable package-based installation method. It should eliminate the freezing issues and provide a smoother installation experience.
